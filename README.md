### 🧠 About Me
I'm an aspiring computer engineer passionate about solving real-world problems.  
From organizing hackathons and co-curating a startup guidebook to building ML models and hardware-software projects, I love blending creativity with technical depth.

I have a **strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **C++**, and I enjoy building scalable, meaningful solutions across domains. Always exploring, always building. 🚀
